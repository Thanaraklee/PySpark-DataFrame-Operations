## Architecture Diagram
1. **Data source (csv):** The project starts with a data source, which is a CSV file containing airline-related information. This CSV file serves as the initial data input.
2. **Data storage (Spark DataFrame):** The data from the CSV file is ingested and stored as a Spark DataFrame. Spark DataFrames are used to efficiently manage and process large datasets in a distributed and parallel manner.
3. **Data analysis functions:** Once the data is stored as a Spark DataFrame, various data analysis functions are applied to gain insights from the dataset. These functions include:
    - **select:** Choosing specific columns or attributes from the DataFrame.
    - **group by:** Aggregating data based on specific columns.
    - **count:** Counting occurrences of data elements.
    - **show:** Displaying a sample of the DataFrame.
    - **filter:** Filtering rows based on specific conditions.
    - **sort:** Sorting the DataFrame based on certain columns.
    - **UDF (User-Defined Function):** Applying custom functions to manipulate or transform data.
